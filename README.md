Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning


This project focuses on predicting breast cancer using various machine learning models. By analyzing the data and visualizing key features, I developed a robust predictive system that can help in early detection and diagnosis.

Key Features:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Employed Pandas and NumPy for data handling and preprocessing, including cleaning and feature selection.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth EDA using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize data distributions and correlations.
Machine Learning Models: Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers. Enhanced model performance through Ensemble Learning techniques.
Model Evaluation: Used a Confusion Matrix to evaluate the models' accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Objective:
To utilize machine learning techniques for predicting breast cancer effectively and to enhance understanding of data-driven approaches in healthcare.
